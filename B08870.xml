            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>FAbles in all Ages, and by many wiſe Men have been accounted excellent ways of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; Neither ought we to think that they were invented only to pleaſe Children, ſince if well conſidered, we may find many excellent Precepts in Philoſophy, Morality and Policy contained in them. But that which gives a full anſwer to this Objection is the many Parables<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Fables contained in Holy Writ, and wiſely contrived for convincing Men of their Folly and Impiety.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What elſe is that of</hi> the Thiſtle which ſent Ambaſſadors to the Cedar that was in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> ſaying, Give me thy Daughter in Marriage to my Son, and to puniſh this pride of the Thiſtle, a wild Beaſt of the Forreſt coming thither trod it down and deſtroyed it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Or that which paſſed among the Trees when they aſſembled together to chuſe a King?</hi> Judges 9.8. The Trees went forth on a time to chuſe a King over them, and they ſaid to the Olive Tree, Reign thou over us; But the Olive Tree ſaid unto them, Should I leave my Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherewith by me they honour God and Man, and go to be promoted over the Trees? And the Trees ſaid to the Fig-Tree, Come thou and Reign over us; but the Fig-Tree ſaid unto them, Should I forſake my ſweetneſs, and my good Fruit, and go to be promoted over the
<pb facs="tcp:191853:3"/> Trees? Then ſaid the Trees unto the Vine, Come thou, and Reign over us; and the Vine ſaid unto them, Shall I leave my Wine which cheereth God and Man, and go to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over the Trees? Then ſaid all the Trees to the Bramble, Come thou and reign over us; and the Bramble ſaid unto the Trees, If in truth you anoint me to be King over you, then come and put your truſt in my ſhadow; and if not, let Fire come out of the Bramble and deſtroy the Cedars of
<hi>Lebanon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And what was the Meſſage that God ſent by</hi> Nathan <hi>to</hi> David <hi>after his Adultery with</hi> Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba, <hi>and his Murder of</hi> Uriah, <hi>to convince him of his great Crimes, when the Prophet tells him,</hi> That there was a Rich Man who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding many Flocks and Herds, but the Poor Man had nothing, ſave one little poor Ewe Lamb which he had brought and nouriſhed up, and it grew up together with him, and with his Children; it did eat of his own Bread, and drank of his own Cup, and lay in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and was unto him as a Daughter; And there came a Traveller to the Rich Man, and he ſpared to take of his own Flock, and of his own Herd to dreſs for the Way-faring Man that was come to him; <hi>What were theſe but myſterious Relations whereby the Divine Spirit touched the Heart of that great King, and brought him to repentance?</hi>

               <hi>In ſhort, when our Bleſſed Lord was upon Earth, what were his diſcourſes to the hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rebellious Jews, but only Parables, for it is ſaid,</hi> Without a Parable ſpake he not; <hi>ſo that Jeſus Chriſt who was Truth it ſelf thought fit to make uſe of this method, as knowing that Truth could be no way more n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>And therefore the Famous Orator</hi> Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <hi>when he obſerved the careleſs demeanour of the Judges of</hi> Athens <hi>at the Tryal of Capital Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders; He by a Fable did ſharply reprimand their unconcernedneſs; And ſuddenly cried out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud,</hi> O ye Judges, I will tell you a very ſtrange Story, if you pleaſe, of the ſhadow of an Aſs; At which the Judges gave great Attention, and commanding ſilence bid him proceed. There was a young Man, ſaith the Oratour, who in an hot Seaſon hired an Aſs to carry ſome Goods, and about Noon being very faint with the heat, he took off his Load intending to lye down and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf under the ſhadow of the Aſs, which the Owner, who went with him to bring back his Beaſt would not permit, alledging, that tho' he hired the Aſs, yet he had paid nothing for the
<pb facs="tcp:191853:4"/> ſhadow of him; The young Man pleaded, that having given him Money for his Aſs the whole day, he might make what uſe of him he pleaſed; The controverſie at length grew high, which at laſt ended in a quarrel, wherein they both ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely beat each other, which yet could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the matter, ſo that they reſolved to bring it to a Tryal at Law. <hi>When the Oratour perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Court very attentive to the Fable he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtopt, and was going away, but being recalled, and deſired by the Judges to proceed in his Story;</hi> Are you,
<hi>ſaid he,</hi> ſo willing to hear an idle Tale of the ſhadow of an Aſs, and yet ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in regarding a Cauſe wherein the Life of a Man is concerned. <hi>Which ſevere Reproof ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Judges, that they were afterward very diligent in examining the matter before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the enſuing Fables I have related none that are to be found in</hi> Aeſop, <hi>but they are collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from divers Ancient and Modern Authors, which I have put into eaſie Engliſh both in Proſe and Verſe, with Pictures to each Fable, whereby they may delight and profit ingenious Readers both old and young, and not only occaſion them to laugh, but give them wholeſome Inſtructions for the prudent government of their Lives and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that neither they nor I may have cauſe to repent our pains, which is the deſire of</hi>

               <p>A Gentleman going through the Market heard a Parrot prating and ſinging ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loud, with whom he was ſo much taken, that demanding the price, he at length agreed, and buying it ſent it home to his houſe, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be hung up in the midſt of his Hall in a Cage; Poll to whom all places were alike, was no ſooner come, but he began to prattle and talk as loud as before; A Cat that belonged to the Houſe, hearing this ſtrange and unuſual noiſe was wonderfully amazed, and could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine from whence it ſhould come; At length
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:191853:17"/> happening to look up, ſhe ſaw a Bird in a Cage, and perceived the voice to proceed from thence; Hey, quoth Puſs, pray whence came you, what's your name, and what buſineſs have you here? The Parrot replied, I came from a very far Country, my name is Parrot, and I am of a worthy Family, whoſe Livery is Green and Red, and happening to be taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive I was put into this Iron Grate to be ſold, and was juſt now bought by your Maſter in the Market. Methinks, ſays the Cat, that being ſo lately come hither you ſhould not have the confidence to make ſuch a bawling as you do; I am ſure had I caus'd but half this diſturbance, I had been in danger to have my brains beat out, for though I was born and bred in this Houſe, yet if I do but cry, and beg for a little victuals, my Maſter, Miſtris and all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ready to kill me; Why, quoth Poll, ſure Miſtreſs Puſs you will not compare my ſinging and prating wherewith Perſons of the beſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are delighted, to your ſqualling which is ſo odious and ungrateful to the ears of all that hear it.</p>

               <p>AN old Fox who had ſpent his whole life in Theft and Rapine, was accuſed by the Hens, Geeſe, Ducks, and Turkeys, of committing many Robberies and Murthers, upon their Wives, Children, Brothers, Siſters, and other Relations, who all Petitioned the Lion their King that he might be brought to a Legal Tryal for the crimes he had committed, and receive condign puniſhment for the ſame; The Lion granted their requeſt, and gave Serjeant Puſs a Warrant to Seize &amp; Arreſt Reynard in the Kings Name; and to commit him to Priſon without Bayl, till he ſhould be delivered by due courſe of Law; The Cat in purſuance of his Commiſſion, goes with other Officers to the Foxes hole in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, where they take him, and tying his hands
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:191853:19"/> behind him carry him to the common Jayl; From whence ſoon after he was brought before the Lion and the reſt who ſate in Judgment upon him; The Witneſſes proved the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him very fully, ſo that he could ſay little in his own defence, only with Lies and Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations denied, and extenuated his faults, but in concluſion the Lion was fully ſatisfied of his guilt, telling him, Certainly you are one of the moſt notorious Raſcals that ever lived in the Forreſt, and a greater Malefactor than the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Farmer,</hi> and for your many Villanies and Murthers deſerve like him to be hanged in Chains, but the Court is ſo kind that you ſhall only be hanged, and this is your Sentence; what have you to ſay why it ſhould not be put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? I will ſay nothing quoth the Fox, againſt your Juſtice, only I deſire one favour, that I may not be carried to the Gallows through the high Street, but on the back ſide of the Town; This the Lion thought was ſome ſubtle trick of his, and asked him his reaſon; Becauſe, quoth he, I know there are great ſtore of Hens and other Fowl that way, whoſe ſight and pleaſant cackling, will much comfort me in that ſad hour, when I think how many pleaſant Meals I have made of the Fleſh of ſome of their Relations.</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:191853:27"/> tells them that what they were doing was to no purpoſe, and that they took pains for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſeeing it was not a Spark of Fire as they imagined, but only a Gloworm which they made ſuch a ſtir about; but they were ſo buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imploy'd that they regarded not her admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; therefore out of her double diligence, thinking they did not hear her, ſhe flies from the Tree, and ſits down by them; crying, Pray, Gentlemen, hear reaſon, you trouble your ſelves in vain, I am aſham'd to ſee your ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Folly; an Ape diſcreeter than the reſt, and who laugh'd at their actions, ſeeing the mighty care and concernment of the Bird, comes to her and admoniſhes her, that ſhe ſhould be cautious, not to indanger her own life, while ſhe was over ſollicitous about their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, but ſhe would take no warning, perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in counſelling and adviſing them ſo long, till a ſly Ape approaching near, ſuddenly leaps upon her, and catching her in his hand, tears her inſtantly to pieces, and eats her up, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe found too late her own Folly in giving Inſtructions to thoſe who had not the ſenſe to receive it.</p>

               <p>A Wolf that was grown old and feeble, and ſo unable to purſue and take his prey as in his former youthful days, was long contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how to maintain himſelf in his decrepit Age; at laſt he found out a ſubtil invention, whereby he did not in the leaſt doubt but to live as plentifully and happily as ever. To which purpoſe he ſeeks out a convenient place near the ſide of a Forreſt, where large flocks of Sheep and other Cattel uſually fed. In the next place he gets a Coat and Breeches, fitted to his body, and in all points exactly like a Shepherd, with a Cap on his head; and then walking upon his hind-feet, he carried a Shepherds Crook up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:191853:31"/> on his ſhoulder; and to make himſelf abſolutely compleat, he ties a pair of Bagpipes to his girdle: Being thus throughly accommodated, he goes confidently toward the flocks, and when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached them, finds the true Shepherd and his Dogs with moſt of the Cattel ſleeping, but yet durſt not attempt to ſeize any of the Sheep for fear of waking the Shepherd and Dogs; and therefore thought upon another ſtratagem, which was to draw one or two of them toward the ſide of the Wood, where he might without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger kill and eat them; And to that end he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to counterfeit the Shepherds voice and call, but this utterly ruined the whole project; for inſtead of whiſtling, he ſet up ſuch a loud howling, that the adjoyning Hills ecchoed again with the noiſe, which likewiſe ſoon rouſed and alarm'd the ſleepy Shepherd and his Dogs, who inſtantly purſue him with full cry; and he being much incommoded and hindred in his flight by his new Accoutrements, they ſoon run him down, and ſo he became an eaſie prey to his Adverſaries, who uncaſing him of his deceitful Clothing, make a quick diſpatch of this Sham Shepherd.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:191853:33"/> a Bridge nor a Boat to help him over, he threw himſelf into the ſtream to avoid his purſuers; but having little skill in ſwimming, before he was half way croſs, the force of the water car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him away with ſuch force, that he ſunk to the bottom, and had certainly been drowned, but that ſome Fiſhermen near hand obſerving it, threw their Nets into the place, and took him up in one of them, and carrying him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore, as ſoon as they had dreined the water out of his Body they ſet him under an old VVall, ſeeming rather dead than alive, at length by the warmth of the Sun he began to recover his ſenſes, but then inſtead of going home to refreſh himſelf, he lay there impertinently relating at large to all that paſſed by the ſtrange Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and terrible dangers which had befallen him that day, together with all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof, and how narrowly he had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with his life; Thus he continued his tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling diſcourſe a great while, till at length the Wall being crazy, fell down and knockt him on the head, in the ruins whereof he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>

               <p>AN Old Wan travelling far from her own houſe, happened to come to a certain place, where ſeveral years before, a terrible battle had been fought between two mighty Armies, and a multitude of men ſlain, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a great number of skulls to lye ſcattered about the Fields; The Woman being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and ſuperſtitious, imagined it to be a work of humanity and charity to have them decently buried; ſhe therefore fills her Apron with many of them, and with much pains and labour, carries them a long way to find a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place for their interment, which before ſhe could diſcover, ſhe had occaſion to go
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:191853:43"/> down a very ſteep hill, where miſſing her footing, all the Skulls ran out of her lap down the Hill, ſome one way and ſome another, at a great diſtance from each other; After ſhe had recovered her ſelf from her fall, inſtead of vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at her misfortune; ſhe burſt out into a loud laughter, and calling after them; nay, nay, quoth ſhe, I do not at all wonder that every one of you runs a different way, ſo far from one another, no queſtion it is but juſt as you did when you were alive, for I believe that you could never agree then, or elſe you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knockt one another on the head; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Old Proverb, <hi>ſo many men ſo many minds;</hi> After the Old Woman had pleaſed her ſelf for ſome time with theſe moral conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe very contentedly gathered the Skulls up again, and digging a hole in the earth ſhe there buried them together, ſaying, you were beſt agree now, for if you ſhould quarrel I ſhall not come to part you.</p>

               <p>A Lion marching furiouſly through the Forreſt, as if he would deſtroy all the Beaſts therein, happened to fall into a Pit, from whence he had little hope of freeing himſelf, and thereupon roars ſo terribly for help, that his voice made all the Wood tremble: The Aſs being nigh, comes to the Pit, to ſee what had befaln His Soveraign, who earneſtly intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his aſſiſtance, by letting him take hold of his Tayl, thereby to ſave himſelf, and in requital he ſolemnly promiſed upon his Royal word, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpare his life, tho' he was never ſo hungry, but likewiſe to free him for the future from the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:191853:45"/> ſlavery he had formerly endured, and that he and his ſhould hereafter enjoy all the Liberties and Priviledges of free-born Subjects. The ſimple Aſs, who had a great reverence for names and Royal promiſes, ſeemed very inclinable to believe and aid him, but the Fox coming by at that inſtant, and being inform'd of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; Sure, quoth he, to the Aſs, you are not ſo great a Blockhead to credit the Lions engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his extremity; can you imagine he will ever change his brutiſh nature, or will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any obligations made in his neceſſity? Is it not the great happineſs of us all that we may now feed ſecurely in the Forreſt, without being indangered either in our Perſons or young Ones by the cruel and arbitrary dealings of this barbarous Tyrant? The Aſs, tho' of a dull and unthinking temper, yet ſeemed to open his eyes at the diſcreet reaſoning of the Fox, and ſo they went both away together, leaving the Lion to ſhift for himſelf, and get out as well as he could.</p>

A man paſſing by, he begg'd of him to unlooſe him, or he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly periſh; the man pitying him, ſaid, If thou wilt ſwear not to poiſon me either with thy teeth or tayl, nor do me the leaſt hurt, I will releaſe thee; the Serpent ſwore he would never harm him while he lived; whereupon the man ſet him free, and they travelled together a great way; at length the Serpent growing hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, endeavoured to kill him; What, quoth he, haſt thou ſo ſoon forgot thy Oath? No, ſays the Serpent, but famine which breaks through ſtone
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:191853:47"/> walls forceth me to it, and makes void all vows. Well, ſays the man, but pray then let me live till the matter be decided by the next honeſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger; content, quoth the Serpent, ſo they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled on, and met with the Raven and her Son, to whom the Serpent related the matter, who hoping to come in for a ſnack, preſently cryed, The Serpent ought to eat the man: He that is a Robber, and lives by blood, is not a fit Judge, ſays the man, let us proceed further. Next they meet with the Bear &amp; the Wolf, who expecting a part like the Raven, were of his opinion; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Serpent ſpits at him to deſtroy him, ſaying, I have had Judgment twice againſt thee, Ay, ſays the man, by murderers themſelves; let us expect better Arbitrators. Soon after they met with the Fox, to whom they likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd; I cannot well decide it, ſays the Fox, unleſs you let the man faſten you as you were when he releaſed you: The Serpent ſuffered himſelf to be tyed faſt; Now, ſays he to the man, if you will again untie him you may; no, quoth the man, there let him lie and die like an ungrateful wretch as he is, and ſo went away laughing at the Serpents folly.</p>

               <p>A Wolf being almoſt famiſht with hunger travelled many Miles, and could find no' booty, at length, as he paſſed through a Wood he heard a Nightingale ſing very loudly and harmoniouſly: The Wolf was mighty glad of the adventure, concluding with himſelf that this muſt needs be ſome large Fowl, and that he ought to ſpare for no pains nor labour to obtain her, ſince he did not queſtion but the purchaſe of ſuch a delicate Banquet would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently recompenſe all the care and trouble he could be at in getting her. Purſuant to this reſolution he follows the pretty Bird by her
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:191853:51"/> voice, ſince by the thickneſs of the leaves he he could not ſee her. Thus with unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence he continued many days hearkening to the melodious ſtrains of poor innocent Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, as ſhe flew from tree to tree, and from buſh to buſh, little ſuſpecting the treachery that was deſigned againſt her. At length by his conſtant and continual watchfulneſs, the Wolf takes an opportunity to ſurprize and ſeize the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Nightingale e're ſhe was aware: But when he had got her, he was more ſurprized than ſhe: Sure, quoth he, my eyes are not my own; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is impoſſible that ſo ſmall an Animal as thou art ſhouldſt make ſo great a noiſe, who art nothing but tail and feather; I did expect that thou hadſt been as big as a wild Gooſe or a wild Duck at leaſt, and reckoned upon it to have made a hearty meal of thee; but alas, how ſtrangely am I diſappointed, and what a ſlender requital ſhall I have, for the watching and faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I have patiently endured ſo many days in purſuit of thee, when inſtead of a belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I find thou wilt only be a mouth-full, and therefore utterly uncapable to ſatisfie my hungry appetite?</p>

               <p>A Deer inhabiting in a large Forreſt, had one time the fortune to ſee a couple of Hounds courſing a Hare over a great field; but being eager in their purſuit, one of the Dogs leaping very eagerly over a hedge, broke his Leg, whereby poor Wat made his eſcape, becauſe the other without his fellows aſſiſtance was not able to ſeize her: The Stag having obſerved all from her ſhelter where ſhe was ſafe, ventured out, ſeeming much concerned that the Hound who had ſhewed ſo much briskneſs in the Chaſe, ſhould periſh for want of help, and therefore much pitying his condition, ſhe offered to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him to the next Village, and accordingly
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:191853:53"/> took him upon her back, in order to convey him to the Town adjoyning: In the way the Deer was diſcourſing how happy he and his fellows ſhould be if the Hounds would not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly follow them by the ſcent to deſtroy them, and how unreaſonable it was for them to make war upon thoſe who ne're offered them the leaſt injury, nor gave them any occaſion for that ſevere treatment which they received from them, while this communication laſted, they were overtaken by a Fox, who having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard what they had been talking of, came up to the Stag, and ſaid, Sir, by your diſcourſe you ſeem to be a ſenſible Creature, and have rightly argued againſt the injuſtice of the Hounds, and yet directly contrary hereunto, you now carry one of the greateſt Enemies you have upon your back, who is at open hoſtility with you and all your Race; and if your life were in his power, as his is in yours, I dare aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, he would ſhew you no mercy: The Stag was a little concern'd at this reaſoning of the Fox, and began to think of throwing him off his back, but recollecting himſelf; Well, quoth he, tho' what you ſay may be true, and he ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, yet ſince I have given him my word to aſſiſt him, I am reſolved to leave him in a place of ſecurity.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:191853:55"/> That is not very difficult, quoth he, it is only by framing your ſelf to flattery and lying: If that be all, quoth the Wolf, I can ſoon practiſe it, and thereupon runs with all ſpeed to the Den, but was no ſooner in e're he cryed out, Ah fough! what a naſty filthy ſtink is here? and then ſeeing the Old Ape hugging her deformed young ones; Surely, quoth he, in my whole life I never ſaw ſuch ugly creatures as theſe are; whereat the Apes being inraged, they all fell upon him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, one biting him by the Noſe, another by the Neck, and the reſt in other places, ſo that he was forced to run out with all ſpeed to ſave his life; and finding the Fox, related his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to him; You are well enough ſerved, quoth he, ſince you forgot my counſel, and ſpoke truth when you ſhould have told lyes: Why, do you think I had loſt my ſmelling and eye-ſight? and yet I told the Ape that her houſe was perfumed with ſweet Wood, and that I was mightily pleaſed to ſee ſuch a beautiful Lady have ſuch a fine off-ſpring of young ones to keep up the family; upon which the beſt in the houſe was ſet before me, but during Supper I was very careful not to ſpeak a word of truth, and hereby I was treated ſo gallantly; or elſe might have ſtarved as you are like to do, e're you have any relief from her.</p>

That, quoth the Fox, which ſome Great ones count a dainty, but I had rather taſte a limb of a Hen. In ſhort Uncle, it was Honey-combs whereof I eat ſo freely, that I have been ill ever ſince; Honey-combs, quoth the Bear! ſure 'tis the beſt victuals upon Earth: Nephew, I hope you don't ſlight Honey; if you could
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:191853:59"/> help me to ſome, you would for ever oblige me: Sure you do but jeſt, quoth the Fox; No, ſays he, I am ſerious, give me but my belly full of Honey, and command me as you pleaſe: Well Uncle, ſays the Fox, I'le ſoon carry you where there is enough to ſerve you ſeven years: The Bear was even raviſht for joy, and inſtantly they went together toward a place where there was a large old Tree, wherein a Carpenter had drove two wedges in order to cleave it; Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard reſolving on revenge for former affronts, cryed out, Look there Uncle, get but into that cleft, and you will find Honey enough, but pray don't over-eat your ſelf: I warrant you, quoth the Bear, I'le take care, and ſo with much haſte entred the Tree with his two feet forward, thruſting his head into the cleft quite over his ears; which the Fox obſerving, inſtantly ran and pluckt out the wedges, ſo that he lockt the Bear faſt therein; who unable to free himſelf, made ſo much noiſe and houling, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter coming out, and finding ſuch a prize, called all his Neighbours to kill the Bear; who perceiving his danger, with much ſtrugling got out his head, but left the ſkin of his ears and claws behind him, and ſo ran bleeding away, being laught at by the Fox for truſting to the friendſhip of a reconciled Enemy.</p>

               <p>THE Birds being deſtitute of a King, they at length concluded to advance the Vulture to the Throne, though they were not inſenſible of his fierce and cruel temper: But the Solemn Oaths and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he made that every Bird ſhould enjoy his own Neſt, as before, without the leaſt diſturbance, prevailed ſo much upon the Falcons, Herns, Storks, and other high flying Birds, but eſpecially with the Magpies, that they admitted him to the Government: He was no ſooner ſetled, but he made it apparent how quickly he had forgot his Obligations; and by the Advice of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens he drove divers of the Storks and Magpies from their antient Neſts, and beſtowed them upon the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: This ſo incenſed them, that they reſolved to call the Eagle to their aſſiſtance, who no ſooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, but the Vulture being ſenſible of the injuries he had offered them, fled in great fear to a thick Wood ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, and ſheltred himſelf in the Dragons Den, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:191853:63"/> the Eagle was made King with the general conſent and applauſe of the Fowls and Birds, and governed the feather'd Nation with great Juſtice and Valour. After a while ſome few Storks, Magpies, Buzzards, Owls and Batts grew diſcontented, pretending that they could not build their Neſts ſo high as they deſired, for they now expected to lodge themſelves in the Cedar Trees, and not in ſuch ſhrubs as they formerly were uſed to: Hereupon they ſecretly aſſemble a number of Birds, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their grievances, and that nothing would relieve them but to recall the Vulture again, and depoſe the Eagle: One of the Magpies then ſtood up and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what ſecurity the Vulture could give that he would not treat them as bad, if not worſe than he did before, if ever he ſhould return again: For, quoth he, The Vulture hath already forfeited his honour and word to us, and what hath he now left, eſpecially ſince his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the Dragon, who is the declared Enemy of all the feather'd Race, and according to the nature of that venomous Serpent, reſolves to burn and deſtroy all before him? Theſe reaſons convinced the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Birds, only three or four Storks, Magpies Buzzards, Owls and Batts, upon the diſcovery of their ill deſigns fled to the Vulture; of which the Eagle having notice, and perceiving their fickle and perfidious humour, he proclaimed them and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents Enemies to the whole Society; and thereby defeated their fooliſh and ridiculous Attempts, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them as the moſt ſenſleſs and ungrateful of all the Fowls of the Air.</p>

Oh, no, quoth the Fox, the quite contrary, for having notice that at the bottom of this Well there was a very great quantity of Fiſh, I went down to fill my belly, where I have been fiſhing ever ſince, and have got ſuch a multitude, and eaten ſo heartily, that I think I ſhall burſt, &amp; yet there's enough left to ſerve you and your young ones a month together, tho' you feed never ſo heartily; I am glad of that, quoth the Wolf, but all the craft will lye in getting them up; Uncle, ſays the Fox, they are all in the Bucket with me, therefore do you but leap into the other Bucket that hangs above, and you will be with me inſtantly; the Wolf preſently leaps into the Bucket, and with his weight ſoon brought up the Fox in the other, who in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by him cried out, good night Uncle, this is the faſhion of the World, ſome go up, and ſome go down, and ſo skipping out run away leaving the Wolf at the bottom of the Well, where he continued till ſome Shepherds coming for water drew him up, and finding what he was, fell upon him with Clubs and Staves, ſo that he hardly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped with his life.</p>

               <p>THE Wolf and the Bear travelling through the Forreſt, the Wolf asked the Bear why he always held down his head toward the ground, I cannot well tell the reaſon of it, ſays he, but I ſuppoſe it proceeds from the ſtiffneſs of my neck; why then do not you get Horns to your Head? quoth the Wolf, as Bulls, and Stags, and Rams, and other Creatures are armed with; whereby you may defend your ſelf againſt your Enemies, and they will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be a great ornament to your forehead? I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:191853:83"/> would have Horns with all my heart, ſays the Bear, but ſince nature has not been ſo kind to beſtow any upon me, I am afraid it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to procure them, why, ſays the Wolf, I believe it may be done, if you will but apply your ſelf to a Man, for they are ſo ingenious that nothing almoſt is too hard for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive. The ſilly Bear did as he counſelled him, and at length he met with a Man who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the buſineſs, but firſt he demanded what he would expect for a reward? I can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing quoth the Workman, that is of any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue about you, except your cropt ears; take them freely, cries the Bear, for a gallant pair of Horns will become me much better than they, and ſo ſuffered his Ears to be cut off with much torture; now, ſays the Operator, I muſt boar two holes in your Head, that they may be ſtrongly faſtened into your thick Skull; What do you think I am mad, quoth the Bear, to have holes made in my Head, ſure you intend to murder me; it is impoſſible to be done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſays the Surgeon; well then, quoth the Bear in a rage, though I have been ſuch a block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head to loſe my Ears, yet I had rather want Horns than loſe my Life; and ſo went away very much diſcontented.</p>

               <p>THE Wolf accuſed the Fox that one day when he was abroad, Reynard came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Den, and ſtole from thence a large quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mutton, which he had left of a Sheep the night before, and reſerved for his Dinner. The Fox utterly denied the matter, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proteſtations and imprecations; at length they concluded to bring the controverſie before the Ape, and make him the Arbitrator and Judge between them; Being come, the Wolf pleaded, that the wicked thieving Fox there preſent, who was known to live by ſpoil and rapine, had feloniouſly rob'd him of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:191853:85"/> in his abſence, and when he deſired him to reſtore his ſtoln goods, he like an impudent Raſcal forſwore it; and that it was not the firſt time by twenty that he had ſerved him, and many other Creatures in the ſame manner, he therefore hoped his Worſhip would now do him juſtice againſt this common Thief. The Fox replies, what this bloudy ravenous Wolf alledges againſt me is altogether falſe, as well as very improbable, for firſt he never ſaw me near his hole, nor has he any witneſs to prove a word he ſays; and in the next place, he is ſuch a devouring hungry villain, that he never leaves any thing over night againſt next day, but is continually lying in wait to murder the innocent, therefore I hope your worſhip will clear me of this ſcandal, and puniſh this falſe accuſer; well quoth the Ape, I find the old Proverb true, that <hi>Two of a Trade can never agree,</hi> and Thieves are ſeldom honeſt to one another; I do not perceive the Wolf hath loſt any thing, and yet I believe the Fox hath ſtoln ſomewhat; let me therefore adviſe you to go home and live as peaceably as people of your Calling can do, but be ſure never to truſt any farther than you can ſee one another.</p>

            <head>A merry Story.</head>
            <argument>
               <p> Having been converſant with Birds and Beaſts I will add one true ſtory thereunto, which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that ſtupidity and ignorance poſſeſs ſome humane Souls to ſuch a degree, that they ſeem to have no more knowledge nor underſtanding than the Beaſts that periſh.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN the Reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a Fellow who wore his Hat button'd up on one ſide, and a Feather therein like a Tooth Drawer, with the Roſe and Crown on his Breaſt for a Badge, had obtain'd a Licenſe from the then Lord Chamberlain to make a ſhow of a great Ape, about the Country, who could perform many notable tricks; &amp; by going to Markets and Fairs, his Maſter pickt up a great deal of Money; the Ape uſually rid upon a Maſtiff Dog, and a Man beat a Drum before him; it happened that theſe four Travellers came to a Town called <hi>Loo</hi> in
<hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi> where having taken an Inn, the Drum beat about the Town to give notice that at ſuch a place was an admirable Ape with very many notable qualities, if they pleaſed to beſtow their money and time to come and ſee him; but the Townſpeople being a ſort of poor Fiſhermen who mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their own imployments, none of them thought it worth their while to ſee this worthy ſight; at which the Fellow being vext, reſolved to put a trick upon them whatever came of it, and thereupon he contrives a Warrant, which he ſends to the Mayor to this effect.
<q>Theſe are to will and require you, and every one of you, with your Wives and Familes, that upon ſight hereof, you make your perſonal appearance before the Queens Ape, for he is an Ape of rank and quality, and is to viſit all Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Dominions, that by his converſe and acquaintance with Her loving Subjects he may be the better enabled to do Her Majeſty ſervice, in diſcovering their fidelity and loyalty. And hereof fail not as you will anſwer the contrary at your utmoſt peril.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:191853:89"/>This Warrant being brought to the Mayor, he ſent for a Shoemaker at the further end of the Town to read it, which when he had heard, he aſſembled his brethren the Aldermen to the Common Hall to conſult of this weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affair; being met, they all ſate ſilent at leaſt a quarter of an hour, no man ſpeaking a word, not knowing what to ſay; at length a young man who had never ſerved any Office ſaid; Gentlemen if I might ſpeak without offence, and under correction of the worſhipful, I would give my opinion in this matter. Pray Neighbour ſpeak freely, quoth the Mayor, for tho' you never yet bore any Office, yet you may talk as wiſely as ſome of us; then ſays the young man, I am of the mind that this Ape carrier is an inſolent ſawcy knave, who deſigns to make our Town ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to the whole Kingdom, for was it ever known that a Fellow ſhould be ſo audacious to ſend a Warrant without either name or date to a Mayor of a Town, who is the Queens Lieutenant, and that he and his brethren, their wives and children, ſhould be all commanded to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before a Jackanapes, therefore my counſel is, that you take him and his Ape, with his Man and his Dog, and whip the whole tribe of them out of the Town, which will be much for your reputation and credit.</p>
            <p>At which words a Grave Alderman being much diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, replied; Friend you have ſpoke little better than Treaſon, remember it is the Queen Ape, and therefore be careful what you ſay; you ſpeak true, brother, quoth the Mayor, I wonder how this ſawcy fellow came into our company, pray friend, depart, I think you long to have us all hang'd; the young man being put out of doors; well now, Brethren, ſays the Mayor, what is to be done in this troubleſome buſineſs? Marry, quoth another old Senior, we may ſee by the Feather in his Cap and the badge he wears, that he is the Queens man, and who knows what power a Knave may have at Court to do poor men in the Countrey an injury? therefore let us e'ne go and ſee the Ape, it is but two pence a piece, and no doubt the Queen
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:191853:89"/> will take it well if it come to her ear, and think that we are very civil people to ſhew ſo much duty to her Ape, what may ſhe imagine we would do to her Bears if they ſhould come hither; Beſides, it is above two hundred mile to <hi>London,</hi> and if we ſhould be complain'd of, and fetcht up by Purſivants or Meſſengers, I'le warrant it would coſt us at leaſt ten Groats a man, whereas we may now come off for two pence a peice.</p>
            <p>This wiſe ſpeech was thought ſo pertinent, that the whole drove of Townſmen with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren went to ſee the Ape, whom they found ſitting on a Table with a chain about his neck, to whom Mr. Mayor put off his Hat and made a Leg, to ſhew his reſpect to the Queens Ape, yet Pug let him paſs unregarded, but Mrs. Mayoreſs coming next in a clean white Apron, with her hands laid upon it, ſhe to ſhew her breeding makes a low Curtſie to him, and Pug like a right Courtier, though he did not mind the Man, yet to ſhew his reſpect to the Woman, put out his paw to her and made a mouth, which the Woman perceiving; Huſband quoth ſhe, I think in my Conſcience the Queens Ape mocks me, whereat Pug made another wry face at her; which Mr. Mayor obſerving, grew very angry, crying, Thou Sirrah Ape, I ſee thy ſaucineſs, and if the reſt of the Courtiers have no more manners than thou haſt, I am afraid they have been better fed than taught, but I'le make thee to know before thou goeſt out of Town that this Woman is my Wife, an ancient Woman and a Midwife, and one that for her Age may be thy Mother; and then going in a rage to the Door where the Apes Tutor was gathering up his pence; ſir, ſays he, do you allow your Ape to abuſe my Wife; no, by no means, quoth the Fellow; Truly ſir, cryes the Mayor, there is ſufficient witneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that ſaw him make mops and mows at her, as if ſhe were not worthy to wipe his Shoes; Pugs Schoolmaſter replied, ſir I'le preſently give him ſevere chaſtiſement for his impudence, and thereupon talking his Whip and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:191853:90"/> holding Jack by the chain, he gave him half a dozen ſmart laſhes, that made Pugs teeth chatter in his head like Virginal Jacks, which Mr. Mayor eſpying, runs to the Fellow and holding his hand, cryed out, Enough, enough, good ſir, you have done like a Gentleman, let me intreat you never to give correction in your wrath, and pray ſir, when the Play is done, be pleaſed to come along with your Ape to my houſe, and both of you take a ſmall ſupper with me and my Wife.</p>
